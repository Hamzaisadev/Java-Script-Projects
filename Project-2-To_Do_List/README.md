## To-Do List App with Local Storage Integration

This is a simple to-do list app that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks.

**Features:**

* Add new tasks.
* Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
* Delete tasks.
* Persist data using localStorage to maintain tasks across browser sessions.

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
* CSS: Defines the style and layout of the web page (fonts, colors, positioning).
* JavaScript: Enables user interaction and task management functionality, including saving tasks in localStorage.

**Getting Started (Local Development):**

1. **Clone the repository:** Make sure you have Git installed. Run `git clone https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list.git` (replace with your repository URL).
2. **Open `index.html` in a web browser.**

**Usage:**

1. Enter your task in the input field.
2. Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed. The task will be crossed out.
4. Click the "X" icon next to a task to delete it.
5. Refreshing the browser window will not clear your tasks, thanks to localStorage.

**Customization:**

* You can customize the app's appearance by modifying the CSS styles.
* Implement error handling for invalid user input (e.g., empty tasks).

**Note:**

This code utilizes absolute paths for image resources. You'll need to adjust them based on your project structure. 

This is a basic to-do list app, and you can extend its functionality by adding features like:

* Prioritization of tasks.
* Due dates for tasks.
* Categories for tasks.

**Enjoy managing your tasks with this simple and effective web app!**
