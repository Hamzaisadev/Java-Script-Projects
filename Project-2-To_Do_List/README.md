# To-Do List App

This is a simple to-do list app that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks:** Easily add tasks to your to-do list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Click on a task to mark it as completed, visually indicating its status.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list when they are no longer needed.
- **Persistent Data Storage:** Utilizes localStorage to maintain tasks across browser sessions, ensuring your tasks are saved even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS:** Defines the style and layout of the web page (fonts, colors, positioning).
- **JavaScript:** Enables user interaction and task management functionality, including saving tasks in localStorage.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

1. **Clone the repository:** Make sure you have Git installed. Run `git clone https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list.git` (replace with your repository URL).
2. **Open `index.html` in a web browser.**

## Usage

1. Enter your task in the input field.
2. Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed. The task will be crossed out.
4. Click the "X" icon next to a task to delete it.
5. Refreshing the browser window will not clear your tasks, thanks to localStorage.

## Customization

- You can customize the app's appearance by modifying the CSS styles.
- Implement error handling for invalid user input (e.g., empty tasks).

## Future Improvements

This is a basic to-do list app, and you can extend its functionality by adding features like:
